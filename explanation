 <!-- Working Procedures or explanation of an application.-->
 
 This is being an Angular Js based application which allow an user to input the link of an repository and in response provide an user
 with-
 
 1. Total number of an Open Issues.
 2. Number of open issues that were opened in the last 24 hours.
 3. Number of open issues that were opened more than 24 hours ago but less than 7 days ago
 4. Number of open issues that were opened more than 7 days ago 
 
   In this the Application UI publish the respective count of an issues of an repository.
   
   In this firstly the User is allowed to input the link of an repository he want to get an list of an issues.
   
  1.  Firstly we would store an URL being given input by the user and trying to fetch out the repository name from the URL.
  2.  After the repository name extraction we were trying to create an link known as apiURL which is being the link of an issues of 
      that respective repository.
  3.  If the link is created successfully we make a Get request to an API endpoint and if the response is successfull then a function 
      is being called to count the number of issues accordingly to question asked.
  4.  Inorder to figure out the time interval of an issues we take an account of an predefined function named gettime() and manipulate 
      it accordingly to figure accordingly to get them falling in the respective time interval.
  5.  We would count the number of issues falling in an repective time period and print accordingly in an table.
  
  
  <!-- Improving Code -->
  
  It might be possible to have an more sophisticated or an improved solution.
  As per to my finding and approach I figured out and came up with e solution. If given more time I would try to figure out more
  improved ,sophisticated, short  solution whch may be might be in any other languages as well.
